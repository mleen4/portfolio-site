        quote: "I had the great pleasure of working with Michael Leen as part of our final capstone project at Deakin University between March and June of 2022, Our capstone project client was the City of Melbourne, and run within our Chameleon virtual company of which I was student leader and project lead for the City of Melbourne project. Michael joined this project initially as a Junior member of the Web Development team and quickly stood out as a reliable, honest, and conscientious team member. Over the first six weeks of the project he quickly demonstrated his ability to analyse problems, research solutions and work both independently and collaboratively with little supervision. Michael took ownership of his goals and assigned tasks and maintained consistently strong communication with his fellow team members and the Chameleon company leadership team. When an opportunity opened up to lead the Web Development team, Michael embraced this opportunity and quickly grew into the role garnering the support and respect of his fellow students. Michaelâ€™s hard work and leadership throughout the project was the primary reason his team were able to deliver on their goal of migrating the web application from an AWS technology stack to a Google Cloud stack. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Michael and confident he will make a great addition to any organisation.",
